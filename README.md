##  How It Works
1. **Ultrasonic sensor** measures the distance to the nearest object.
2. **Arduino** processes the data and decides the next move.
3. If an obstacle is detected within a threshold distance:
   - Robot stops
   - Rotates sensor (optional) to scan the environment
   - Chooses the safest direction
4. **Motors** execute movement to avoid collision.

### Hardware Setup
- Connect the **HC-SR04** to Arduino pins (Trigger, Echo).
- Wire **DC motors** to L298N driver and connect ENA/ENB for speed control.
- Connect **servo motor** (if used) to Arduino PWM pin.
- Power the system with a battery pack (6x AA or Li-ion).
- To easily view look at the schematic image.
